## 1. UX

### 1.1 Overview

As a young child (and to this day, I will admit), I used to love spotting the different airlines from the sky by their airline logos. It used to keep us quite entertained as children, so why not turn it into a memory card matching game? I chose this project simply as there has never been a better time to switch off from the news around us lately and maybe even exercise our brains with this fun card- matching game.

### 1.2 What is the challenge of the game?

To match as many pairs in as little time as possible and the player is rewarded points for every match they find- bonus points for every second remaining.

### 1.3 User Stories

As a site user:
-	I want a site that is easy to navigate through and to play a game that is fun and interactive
-	To be able to change the level of the game (easy, medium hard)
-	To be able to track my progress as I play
-	To be able to see my results post game or see how I fare against other players
-	Easily navigate around the site, understand easily the rules of the game and return to the home page if needed

As a site developer, I would like the site to accomplish:
-   Shuffle the cards on reload or start of game
-	Display the progress of the game to the user with a timer
-	Use a star rating other than points to simplify the game
-	A restart button to allow the user reset the game, timer and star rating
-	A well done/congratulations modal to appear when the player has completed the game
-	A “game over” modal to appear to let the player know they ran out of time and to give the player the chance to replay the game
